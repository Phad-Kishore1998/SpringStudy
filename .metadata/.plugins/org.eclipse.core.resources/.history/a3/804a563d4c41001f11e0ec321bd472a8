With JAVA EE : we have to buy house and do the interiors (A lot configuration Server, DB, Dependency)
With Java Spring Framework : We got a butler to do the interiors (IOC, AOP, DI) (2003) (By Rod Johnson)
With Java Spring boot : We get fully furnished house. (Good Enough defaults in Project) (2014) (2009 sold to VMware)

:=> Spring Framework: Spring is a dependency injection framework to make java application loosely coupled.
Spring framework makes the development process easy for JavaEE Application.
:=> Spring enables you to build application from POJO and to apply enterprise services 
non-invasively(Code does not have to take care of applying enterprise benefits like logs, health checker, etc to POJOs) to POJOs.

Important Components:
Core Container (Beans Core Context Expression Language)
AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)
JDBC
Web
Testing


IoC Container: Core component of Spring Framework, it takes control away from the user as sometimes. we dont want to be controller of the code.
Its like event Driven programming (EDP). IOC controls: EDP, AOP and DI. 
Your Business Logic (Object POJOs) + Configuration MetaData(XML) => [Coming to Spring Container] => Produces: Fully Configured System (Ready for use) 


In the Spring Framework, the IoC Container is responsible for managing the components of an application and injecting dependencies into them.
The container creates the objects(beans), wires them together, configures them, and manages their complete lifecycle.




Starter code by : Spring Initializer

In resources folder>application.properties
	we can do the configuration
	like port change to 9000 for tomcat, etc
	Details for the link: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/appendix/application-properties/index.html
	it contains all the properties.

server.port=8080
debug = true


We have the test java files: Unit Test
This is called Test Driven Development.




In Target File:
	we have the jar files and output files.
	
mvnw:=> maven utility

pom.xml :=> maven job to get the dependencies


========================================Beans================================================

Bean is a managed object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by Spring IoC Container.
Beans form the backbone of a Spring application and are the core bulding blocks that
are wired together to craete the application.

Understand:
In java we use to create a object of class
	like: Car obj = new Car();
	obj is a object of Car class.
	
In spring we no longer need a new keyword to create a instance
all that we will be handled and this object in Spring is called a bean without a new.

As car() will be requiring the constructor values to instantiate but all this is handled
by IoC 


Spring Annotations

Traditionally, spring allows a developer to manage bean dependencies by using
XML-based configuration.

But, Annotations: metadata for the code.
There is an alternative way to define beans and their dependencies.
This is a Java-based configuration.
Unlike The XML Approach, java based configuration allows you to manage bean
components programmatically.
That's why spring annotations were introduced.


============================SpringBoot/Spring Framework==================================

Starter Dependency : In Spring Boot like webservices.
Auto Configuration : In Spring Boot what happens after Run button.
						There are alot config files in Meta-INF of the Maven Dependencies.
Externalized Configuration
Embedded Tomcat, Jetty Servers : In pom.xml web Starter has multiple dependencies in it.
Built-in Metrics & Health Checks 




===========================================================================================
================================Auto Config. and Maven====================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pom.xml : Maven is a popular build automation tool used in many Java Projects.
In a Spring Boot Project, dependencies are specified in the pom.xml file.
Maven then resolves these dependencies and includes them in the classpath.

Starters like spring-boot-starter-parent include a ton of third-party
libraries into your project - by default.
Its AutoConfigurations use these dependencies to setup and preconfigure
these libraries automatically.

The spring=boot-dependencies pom.xml contains very 3rd party library
(and version) that Spring Boot knows. These libraries predefined in a dependencies
Management section, So you do not need to specify the version numbers in your own
projects, anymore.


======================== What is Auto Configuration===========================================
AutoConfiguration refers to the mechanism that automatically configure
Spring applications based on the dependencies present on the classpath
and other application-specific settings.

This feature simplifies the setup and development process, allowing developers
to focus more on writing business logic rather than configuring the framework.


======================== How AutoConfig Works===============================================

Classpath Scanning

Spring Boot scnas the classpath for the presence of certain libraries and classes
Based on what it finds, it applies corresponding configurations.

eg. entry point is One: SpringBootApplication
inside that we have EnableAutoConfiguration
and one more is there which is ComponentScan from this package.
	
	
Configuration Classes

Spring boot contains numerous autoconfiguration classes,
each responsible for configuring a specific part of the application.


Autoconfigue >Meta-InF>spring>.class and in this we have the many autoconfigure lines
for all the things.


Conditional Beans:

Each autoconfiguration class uses conditional checks to decide if it should be applied.
These conditions include the presence of specific classes the absence of user-defined
beans, and specific property settings



========================================================================================

Core features of AutoConfiguration

@PropertySources Auto-registration

When you run the main method of your Spring Boot Application,
Spring Boot will Autoamtically register 17 of the 
Property Sources for you: 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html


OS Env Variables and Command line argument
They define different properties behavior


META-INF/Spring/org.springframewokr.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports

Every spring boot project has a depenedency on the following library:
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure.
It is a simple .jar file containing pretty much all of Spring Boot magic



Enchaned Conditional Support

Spring boot comes with its own set of additioanl @Conditional annotations,
which make developers live easier

@ConditionalOnBean(DataSource.class)
The condition is true
only if the user specified a DataSource @Bean in a @Configuration.

@ConditionalOnClass(DataSource.class)
The condition is true
if the DataSource class is on the classpath.

@ConditionalOnProperty("my.property")
The condition is true
if my.property is set



Spring Boot is a just a bunch of AutoConfigurations classes
(== normal Spring @Configuration), that create @Beans for you if certain @Conditons are met!


=====================Spring Boot Internal Flow==================================

1. Initialization: When you start a spring boot application,
the main entry point is typically a class annoted with @SpringBootApplicaiton
(or its meta-annotations). This annotation combines serveral other
annotations such as @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.

2. Spring Applicaiton context Creation: 
Spring boot creates an application context which serves as the container for managing
beans and their dependencies. It scans the classpath for components, configuration 
and auto-configurations, and initializes the application context based on the 
detected classes and dependencies

3. Auto-Configuration: Spring Boot auto-configures beans and components based on the 
classpath and detected dependencies. it uses conditional annotations
(@ConditionalOnBean(DataSource.class)
@ConditionalOnClass(DataSource.class)
@ConditionalOnProperty("my.property") ) to conditionally configure beans only if
certian conditions are met.


4. Externalized Configuration: Spring Boot loads configuration properties
form various sources such as property files, YAML files, Environment variables,
and command-line arguments. It provided sensible defaul values for configuration
properties and allows them to be easily overridden or customized.


5. Embedded Web Server Initialization: If the applicaiton is a web applicaiton,
Spring Boot initializes the embedded web server (such as Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow)
based on the applicaiotn's dependencies and configurations.
It configures the server with sensible defaults and starts it to listen for 
incoming requests.

6. Application Startup: Spring Boot invokes lifecycle callbacks such as 
@PostConstruct methods and initialization callbacks on beans as the application
context is being initialized. Beans are instantiated, dependencies are injected and 
necessary initialization logic is executed.


7. Application Ready: Once the initialization process is complete, 
the application context is fully initialized and ready to handle requests.
The embedded web server is up and running, and the application is 
ready to serve incoming HTTP requests.





========================== Maven ========================

Maven is a build automation tool and project management tool 
primarily used for Java projects. It plays a crucial role in the
development, build, and dependency management of Spring application,
including those using Spring frameworks component scanning and 
annotation-driven configuration.


========================== Project & Dependency Management============================

Maven provides a standardized way to manage Java projects by defining project structure,
dependencies, and build configurations using a declarative XML-based format (pom.xml)

Developers use Maven to specify project metadata, dependencies,
plugins, repositories, and other project-related configurations.

Spring Framework and its various modules (eg. Spring Core, Spring MVC,
Spring Boot) are managed as dependencies projects.
Developers specify the Spring dependencies in the pom.xml and Maven handles the rest.


=========================== Build Automation =========================================

maven automates the build process, including compilation, testing, packaging, and
deployment, using predefined build lifecycles phases (eg. clean, compile, test,
package, install).

Maven facilitates the building and packaging of Spring applications into deployable
artifacts(eg. JAR files, WAR files) for deployment in production environments.



Maven Commands


./mvnw compile 

We compile the projects source code Using this command and get result in target folder

./mvnw package

this will bundle the project into jar file.


Then friends can use 
java -jar ./target/introductionToSpringBoot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

this will start our application on local machine.


I used the mvn compile
and mvn package for jar.


mvn clean : it will clean the target folder here.


mvn test : all the the test will be executed.

mvn install : 
mvn deploy : 
mvn spring-boot:run
	this what is executed by the start button.
	
mvn spring:boot:build-image
	this is for docker image
