	 	Defining Beans

1.Using Stereotype Annotations

Annotate your class with one of the stereotype annotations
(@Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller).
These Annotations inform spring that class should be managed as a bean.

2. Explicit Bean declaration in configuration Class

Create a configuration class and annotate it with @Configuration.
This class will contain methods to define and configure beans.

:=> We can load this configuration whenever required.

/*
========================================Beans LifeCycle=====================================

Bean Created
The bean instance is created by invoking a static factory method
or a instance factory method(for annotation-based configuration).

Dependency Injected 
Spring sets the bean's properties and dependencies either through setter injection,
constructor injection, or field injection
eg. :=> Apple injected in bean Spring Application.

Bean Initialized

if the bean implements the initializingBean interface or defines a 
custom initialization method annotated with @PostConstruct,
Spring invokes the initialization method after the bean has been configured.
eg. :=> after all the dependency injected to beans.

Bean is Used
The bean is now fully initialized and read to be used by the application.
eg. :=> in the run method of application.

Bean Destroyed
Spring invokes the destruction method when the bean is no longer needed or when 
the application context is being shut down.
